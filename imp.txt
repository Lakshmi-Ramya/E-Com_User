very important stuff to remember:

- Next js runs on Node js.
- Next js is a framework that is built on top of React and Node.js
- It is specifically designed for building React based applications
- Next.js applications run on a Node.js server. 
    When you use features like server-side rendering or API routes in Next.js, 
    Node.js is responsible for executing the server-side code.
- When you run a Next.js application, it starts a Node.js server to handle incoming requests,
    perform server-side rendering, and execute server-side logic.

-->> regarding MONGODB:

why is MONGODB used in your project but not MySQL?

ans: 
Mongodb is used in our project because it is more compatible due to various reasons like:

- JSON Like Documents:
    It stores data in a flexible, JSON like BSON ( Binary JSON ) format.
    It aligns well with JSON used in both Node js and NextJS

- Schema less design:
    Mongo Db is schema-less
    allowing developers to insert data without a predefined schema
    This is an advantage during the development phase, especially while working with rapidly changing data models
    or in scenarios where schema is not well defined

- No SQL joins:
    designed to scale horizontally by sharding data across multiple servers

- Middleware and libs:
    it has dedicated libs and middleware designed for Node js, making integration seamless.

- Async Nature of Node.js:
    more effecient handling of db operations without blocking the event loop.


-->> Tech used:

- Next js ( for server side and client side rendering)
- React js ( for client side rendering )
- Styled components, Tailwind css and Material UI ( for Styling and designing )
- NextAuth ( for user authentication -> google sign in )
- Mongodb ( for storing data in the database )
- AWS S3 buckets ( for storing the images, so users can access them globally )
- Stripe ( for payments )
